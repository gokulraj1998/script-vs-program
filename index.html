    <div  class="c"><div class="a"><center><h1><strong><i>Scripting Language<br><b>Vs</b><br> Programming lanugage</i></strong></h1></center><br><p>Every scripting language is basically a programming language. The only theoretical difference is that a scripting language does not include the compilation step- it is interpreted instead. For instance, one needs to first compile a C program before running it. On the other hand, one does not need to compile a scripting language such as PHP or JavaScript.</p></div><div class="b"><div class="p"><center><h4>Scripting Language</h4></center><br><ul class="u"><li>Easy to learn and use- They are often a great starting point for those who want to step their foot in the world of development. They are easy to learn and implement. JavaScript and PHP are some of the easiest scripting languages.</li>
    <li>Open-source and free- Most of the scripting languages are open-sourced, which means there are no limits on who can utilize scripting languages. All they have to do now is study them and integrate them into their existing system. They’re all open-source, which means anyone around the world can contribute to their development.</li>
    <li>Powerful and extensible- Scripting languages are powerful (in terms of application) enough so that the necessary tasks can be accomplished with the scripts. Scripting languages are also highly extensible, i.e., you can add certain features if you feel them necessary.</li>
    <li>Cross-Platform- Scripting languages offer another significant advantage: they are portable and cross-platform, as they execute on a remote server or in the visitor’s web browser. This means they don’t require any additional software to run, and they can be used with any browser on any operating system and platform.</li>
    <li>Runtime Execution- An application can be configured and modified while it is running using a system that permits code to be executed during runtime. This capacity is, in fact, the most important feature that makes scripting languages so important in most applications. Debugging and a rich in-game console are both aided by runtime code execution.</li></ul></div><div class="s"><center><h4>Programming Lanuage</h3></center><br><ul class="uu"><li>Machine language- Machine language is a type of low-level language that computers can understand easily. They are composed of instructions in binary or hexadecimal and are the elemental language of computers.</li>
    <li>Assembly language- Assembly language (ASM) is yet another low-level programming language created for specific processors. It is just a symbolic and human-understandable representation of the collection of instructions. It translates assembly language to machine language using an assembler.</li>
    <li>: Most modern languages like Python have a simple learning curve. There is usually a tradeoff between the simplicity of a language and its speed and abstraction (ability to hide complicated details).</li>
    <li>It refers to the ability of the programming language to hide complicated details which might be unnecessary for the users. It is one of the most important and essential features of object-oriented programming languages.</li>
    <li> To avoid consuming too much memory or taking too long, programming languages are translated and performed efficiently.</li></ul></div>
